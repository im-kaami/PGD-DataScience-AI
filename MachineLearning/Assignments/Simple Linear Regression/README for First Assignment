# Linear Regression with Per Capita Income Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of **Simple Linear Regression** using a dataset about per capita income in Canada.

## Contents

- `Assignment01_canada_per_capita_income.ipynb`: The main notebook that includes the following:
  - Data loading and exploration.
  - Visualizing the relationship between year and per capita income.
  - Implementing and training a simple linear regression model.
  - Model evaluation and making predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`

You can install the libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset contains two columns:
- `Year`: The year corresponding to the data point.
- `Per Capita Income`: The per capita income of Canada in USD.

The goal is to predict the per capita income for a given year using simple linear regression.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Assignment01_canada_per_capita_income.ipynb"
   ```

4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and follow along with the explanation.

## Example Workflow

1. **Data Loading:**
   Load the dataset containing year and per capita income data.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   Visualize the relationship between the year and per capita income using scatter plots.

3. **Model Training:**
   Train a simple linear regression model to predict per capita income based on the year.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions for future years.

## Results

The notebook demonstrates:
- How to fit a simple linear regression model.
- Visualizing the regression line overlaying the data points.
- Using the model to make predictions for specific years.
