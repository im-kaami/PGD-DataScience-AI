# Simple Linear Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of **Simple Linear Regression**. The goal of simple linear regression is to find the relationship between one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (target) using a straight line.

## Contents

- `Starting with Simple Linear Regression.ipynb`: The main notebook that includes the following:
  - Loading and exploring a dataset.
  - Data visualization to understand the relationship between variables.
  - Training a simple linear regression model.
  - Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`

You can install the libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Starting with Simple Linear Regression.ipynb"
   ```

4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and follow along with the explanation.

## Example Workflow

1. **Data Loading:**
   Load a dataset containing features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable).

2. **Data Visualization:**
   Visualize the relationship between the predictor and the target variable using scatter plots.

3. **Model Training:**
   Fit a simple linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   Use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Results

The notebook provides a detailed walk-through of:
- How to fit a simple linear regression model.
- How to interpret the coefficients of the regression line.
- Visualizing the regression line over the data points.
- Assessing the model's accuracy using evaluation metrics.
