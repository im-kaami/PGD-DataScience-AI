# Multilinear Regression with Housing Prices Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of Multiple Linear Regression to predict housing prices based on property features.

## Contents

- Multilinear Regression.ipynb: The main notebook that includes the following:
  - Data loading and exploration.
  - Visualizing the relationships between features and the target variable.
  - Preprocessing data (handling missing values and preparing features).
  - Implementing and training a multiple linear regression model.
  - Model evaluation and making predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn

You can install the libraries using the following command:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset `homeprices.csv` contains the following columns:

- area: The size of the house in square feet.
- bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.
- age: The age of the house in years.
- price: The price of the house.

The goal is to predict the house price based on the given features using multiple linear regression.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd <repository-folder>

3. Place the `homeprices.csv` dataset in the project directory.

4. Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook "Multilinear Regression.ipynb"

5. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and follow along with the explanation.

## Example Workflow

1. Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset containing house features and prices, and explore the data.

2. Data Visualization: Visualize the relationships between features (e.g., `area`, `bedrooms`, and `age`) and the target variable (`price`).

3. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and prepare the features for modeling.

4. Model Training: Train a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices based on the given features.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance and interpret its coefficients.

6. Making Predictions: Use the trained model to predict house prices for new inputs.

## Results

The notebook demonstrates:

- How to fit a multiple linear regression model.
- Visualizing the regression model and interpreting its coefficients.
- Making predictions for house prices based on specific features.
